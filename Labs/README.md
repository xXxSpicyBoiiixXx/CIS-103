# CIS-103 Fundamentals of Programming Labs

Description: Overall, we will be leveraging Python for the labs to showcaes the material and logic presented in the textbook. If you are comfortable in another programming language, please let me know and we can discuss it. If you are a beginner or entirely new to programming, than the best idea is to use Python.

### IDE (Interactive Development Environment)

This will be a homework question: What is an IDE? Please explain why you would use this and the pros and cons of using an IDE. 

On your system, you will need to use some sort of IDE or you can use tools like nano or vim if you wanted to use the terminal. My recommendation if you're new to this is using a program PyCharm from JetBrains. You can download this from www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download. To get started with the IDE, you can view the tutorial from www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/learn/. If you need help with the installation with this, feel free to set up time with me so we can walk through it. 

For the course, I will be using "vim", which is a text editor that you can use within the terminal. If you're interested in more system oriented programming I would suggest to get comfortable with a text editor, but it will be a steep learning curve. Vim has a nice tutorial but you will need to spend about 1 to 2 hours and use it daily to get use to the mechanism. 

Other IDEs that you can use if PyCharm isn't for you: 

- VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
- Thonny 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- IDLE 

Please note, I will not go over these IDEs so if you don't know what to use, stick to PyCharm.  

### Lab Assignments

Lab assignments will be due the following lab at the start of the lab sessions. These assignments will be done independantly.
